# Project 3

Project 3 runs a restaurant simulation for our restaurant named Molly's Mouthwatering Rolls. The simulation is structured using 3 design patterns: the factory pattern to generate daily customers for the restaurant, 
the observer pattern to print daily and total simulation reports, and the decorator patter that can add extras to rolls.  

## To run the simulation: 
- Download the project files
- Open with something that can run Java
- Run the program
- Enter in the amount of days that you would like to run the simulation for 
- Enter in the number of rolls that you would like to run the simulation for ( to run the simulation for 30, 45, & 60 rolls just input that number here!)
- Click on the oputut.txt file that is generated after running to view the output from the simulation!
